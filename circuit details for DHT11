Connections :

DHT11 sensor and DC MOTOR : 

Use a NPN Transistor
•	Connect EMITTER to a terminal of motor
•	Connect BASE to a resistor of 220ohm and connect it to pin 2 of Arduino
•	Connect COLLECTOR to another terminal of motor
Photoresistor :

Connect one end of Photoresistor 5V
Connect other end with a resistor of 220 ohm and also connect the same end with Arduino on Analog 1
Connect the other end of resistor with GND

LED
Connect the Positive end of LED with a resistor and connect to 5V
Connect the negative end to GND
